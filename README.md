## Introduction

The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market has seen significant growth in recent years, as artists, creators, and individuals are using NFTs to monetize their digital assets and creativity. Despite this growth, the NFT market remains highly speculative and the value of individual NFTs can be difficult to predict, leading to increased risks for NFT creators and owners. Also NFT markets is skewed towards established NFT creators than to a newbie. So an artist new to NFT world finds it difficult to navigate and establish himself. Even then, he may end up having no sale or selling his NFT for very value. An cursory look at Objkt marketplace provides that more than 30% of NFTs and atleast 20% of NFTs are burned on a daily basis.

To address these challenges and support the budding NFT culture on Tezos, we propose the creation of a new crypto token that acts as a buyer of last resort of NFTs, serves as a tipping token and has inflation resistant auto-burn functionality. This token will provide a stable and reliable source of demand for NFTs, helping to mitigate the risks of speculation and volatility in the NFT market and support the NFT ecosystem. By bridging the NFT and DeFi communities, the token can help to support the growth and development of the Tezos ecosystem and provide new opportunities for collaboration and innovation

In addition, we plan to use token to experiment with the concept of 

1. Universal Basic Income (UBI)

2. Stable coins creation with burn functions

## Goddess Orbona

In ancient Roman religion, Orbona was worshipped as the protector of orphans and as the one who provided for their needs. She was considered to be a gentle and nurturing deity, who cared for the vulnerable and disadvantaged. Orbona also represented a timeless ideal of compassion and care for those in need, and serving as an inspiring symbol of the power of kindness and generosity to change the world for the better. In similar way our project is built on the idea that a token serves as a source of stability and security for NFT creators and owners.
    
## Orbona token 

The Orbona Token is a new token that will be introduced on the Tezos network as part of this project. The token aims to support the budding NFT culture in Tezos by acting as a buyer of last resort, a NFT tipping token and to contain inflation through its auto-burn mechanism. This whitepaper outlines the key features and benefits of the Orbona Token and explains how it can help to support and grow the NFT market in Tezos.


### Buyer of Last Resort
The Orbona Token will act as a buyer of last resort for NFTs, providing a stable source of income for NFT creators and owners. This helps to ensure that NFTs remain valuable and that their creators and owners are able to make a living from their work.

The buyer of last resort aspect of the Orbona Token aligns with the principles of Universal Basic Income (UBI) (which aims to provide a basic standard of living to all citizens, regardless of their circumstances). By acting as a form of UBI for the NFT community, the Orbona Token helps to support the growth and development of the NFT market and attract new participants to the  Tezos ecosystem. It will help NFT artist , collectors in following 


1. <b> Stability and predictability: </b> Orbona token will provide a stable and predictable source of demand for NFTs, helping to mitigate the risks of speculation and volatility in the NFT market.

2. <b> Support for NFT artists:</b> By providing a reliable source of demand for NFTs, the Orbona token will help to support NFT artists and creatives, enabling them to monetize their work more effectively and providing financial stability and security.

3. <b> Increased liquidity:</b> The presence of a buyer of last resort will increase the liquidity of the NFT market, making it easier for NFTs to be bought and sold on the open market.

### NFT Tipping 


Tipping is a way for NFT (Non-Fungible Token) owners and fans to show appreciation and support for NFT artists and creators. In the traditional art world, artists are often compensated through the sale of their works or through commissions. However, in the NFT world, it can be more challenging for artists to monetize their creations and earn a livelihood. Tipping is a way for the NFT community to directly support artists and reward them for their work.

Tipping can also help drive engagement and interaction within the NFT community. By allowing NFT collectors and fans to easily tip NFT artists, it encourages more participation and helps to build a thriving NFT ecosystem. This can lead to more creativity and innovation within the space, which can ultimately benefit everyone involved.

Tipping NFT artists has several benefits for both artists and collectors.

1. <b>Increased Recognition: </b> Tipping NFT artists will help them to gain recognition for their work. This will help artists to build their reputation and reach a wider audience.

2. <b>Monetization: </b> Tipping NFT artists will provide them with a new source of income and help them to monetize their work.

3. <b>Incentive to Create: </b> Tipping NFT artists will provide them with an incentive to continue creating NFTs and improve their work.

4. <b>Strengthening the NFT Community: </b> Tipping NFT artists will help to strengthen the NFT community by fostering a culture of support and recognition.

In addition to acting as a buyer of last resort, the Orbona Token can also be used as a tipping token for NFT creators and owners. This provides a way for fans and supporters to show their appreciation for NFTs and the work of their creators and owners. By using the Orbona Token for tips, NFT fans can help to increase the visibility and exposure of NFTs and support their creators and owners.

### Auto-Burn Mechanism

Inflation is a common concern in the cryptocurrency world, and it can lead to the devaluation of a token over time. To combat this, the Orbona Token has an auto-burn mechanism built into it, which reduces the overall supply of tokens over time. This helps to maintain the value of the token and ensure that its purchasing power remains stable over time.

The auto-burn mechanism is triggered every time the Orbona Token is used for NFT purchases or tips or nay transactions. A portion of the token is burned, reducing its overall supply, and increasing the scarcity of the remaining tokens. This helps to maintain the value of the token and prevent it from losing its purchasing power over time.

1. <b> Inflation Control: </b> By design, the auto-burn mechanism reduces the overall supply of tokens in circulation, helping to control inflation and maintain the token's value over time. This is particularly important for long-term investment strategies and can provide stability and security to token holders.

2. <b> Scarce Token: </b> The auto-burn mechanism makes the token inherently scarce, which can increase its perceived value and attractiveness to potential buyers. This scarcity can also drive demand for the token and result in increased liquidity in the market.

3. <b> Alignment with Sustainable Practices: </b> The auto-burn mechanism aligns with the principles of sustainable practices and supports the responsible use of resources. By reducing the overall supply of tokens, the auto-burn mechanism helps to reduce waste and promote efficient use of resources.


These combined features make the Orbona token a unique and valuable tool for participants in the Tezos NFT ecosystem, and its USP lies in the fact that it provides multiple functions and benefits for its users.

## Roadmap:

   <b> Q2 2023: </b> Orbona token launch, initial marketing and promotion.
   
   <b> Q3 2023: </b> Development of a Buyer of last resort platform, partnerships with NFT creators and communities.
   
   <b> Q3 2023: </b> Development of a user-friendly NFT tipping platform, integration with popular NFT marketplaces.

## Technical Components

### Home

Home is the place where users can deposit their NFTs for fixed number of Orbona Tokens. Number of the tokens is fixed amount in Orbona tokens for 1/1 art editions. If there are mulitple editions of same art work , then tokens awarded will be divided by the number of the editions and will sent to the depositer address.

### Gallery

Gallery is the a place where benefactors can send their tips to their beleoved artist and art. Since tips act as a form of reputation in identifing the popular art and artists, in return of the tips , the benefactors will be provided with rewards on a monthly basis. The rewards for each benefactor will be calculated using quandratic funding as used in Gitcoin so as prevent any fraudlent tipping.

 <i> Quadratic funding is a mechanism that aims to address the challenge of "voting power centralization" in traditional funding models by providing proportional funding to smaller participants. This method provides larger rewards to participants who contribute smaller amounts of funds, which can incentivize wider participation and help to reduce the concentration of voting power in the hands of a few large participants. </i>

### Townhall (aka DAO)

Friends of Orbona (FOO) who holds Orbona Tokens will take part in the governance in The Townhall. They can vote on the following

1. Amount of Orbona Tokens that is dispensed by Home for the deposited NFT
2. Burn rate for Orbona Token
3. Total amount needed to be allocated as partipating rewards for benefactors 

Initially Townhall will be set at Homebase DAO and may evolve into the separate contract.

## Conclusion

The Orbona Token being developed on the Tezos network combines the benefits of an auto-burn mechanism, a buyer of last resort and a NFT tipping token. By supporting the NFT market, providing a stable source of income for NFT creators and owners and providing a way for fans to show their appreciation, the Orbona Token can help to promote the growth of the NFT culture in Tezos.
